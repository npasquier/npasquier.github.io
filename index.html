                    Risk aversion and equilibrium selection in a vertical

                    The theoretical literature on vertical relationships usually
                    assumes that beliefs about secret contracts take specific
                    forms. In a recent paper, Eguia et al. (2018) propose a new
                    selection criterion that does not impose any restriction on
                    beliefs. In this article, we extend their criterion by
                    generalizing it to risk-averse retailers, and we show that
                    risk aversion modifies the size of the belief subsets that
                    support each equilibrium. We conduct an experiment which
                    revisits that of Eguia et al. (2018). We design a new
                    treatment effect on equilibrium selection depending on the
                    retailersâ€™ risk sensitivity. Experimental results confirm
                    the treatment effect: the more sensitivity there is towards
                    risk, the more the equilibrium played is consistent with
                    passive beliefs. In addition, extending the Eguia et al.
                    (2018)'s' criterion to risk-averse retailers improves its
                    predictive power on the equilibria played, especially for a
                    population of retailers with moderate to extreme risk
                    aversion.

                    When a firm appoints a new manager, it reopens the
                    possibility of new contractual friction with its partners.
                    We explore strategic ambiguity as a potential for friction
                    with a supplier. The firmâ€™s new manager probably has fuzzy
                    expectations about the supplierâ€™s strategy. An optimistic
                    manager weights favorable strategies more heavily than
                    detrimental ones, whereas a pessimistic manager does the
                    opposite. We show that the managerâ€™s degree of optimism is
                    critical: above a threshold, it can cause the supplier to
                    change the timing of its contracting and increase its
                    profits. We also find that this threshold degree of optimism
                    depends on the degree of product substitution: it is more
                    stringent with imperfect substitutes than with perfect
                    substitutes or unrelated goods.

                    We study a vertically integrated producer (VIP) supplying a
                    downstream firm under price competition. The VIP may
                    decentralize the final price decision to its downstream
                    unit, thereby obliging the latter to ignore the effect of
                    the output price on upstream sales. We find that
                    decentralization benefits the VIP, irrespective of products
                    being substitutes or complements. Decentralization also
                    benefits the consumers when products are substitutes, but it
                    harms them when products are complements. Interestingly,
                    when products are substitutes, decentralization decreases
                    both output prices despite restoring a double margin on the
                    downstream unitâ€™s sales.

                    Distortion in Promoting Personalized Pricing by Asymmetric

                    We present a model of duopoly competition in a marketplace
                    with a Hotelling segment of consumers, where two business
                    users (firms) have access to raw consumer data. The firms
                    can choose between personalized prices (PP), using a costly
                    personalized program device provided by the marketplace, or
                    uniform prices at no additional cost. One firm has a higher
                    level of experience in utilizing consumer data, resulting in
                    a lower cost of price personalization (PP device cost). In
                    order to promote its personalized program device, the
                    marketplace may have an incentive to distort consumer
                    preferences from a uniform to a triangular distribution. Our
                    findings indicate that the marketplace is more likely to
                    distort consumer preferences under specific conditions. This
                    occurs when there is moderate asymmetry in experience
                    between the firms and a high tariff for the program, or when
                    there is weak asymmetry and a moderate program tariff. In
                    these parameter regions, the distortion of consumer
                    preferences negatively impact the profits of the sellers
                    while benefiting the consumers. These insights contribute to
                    a better understanding of the dynamics of digital
                    marketplaces and have implications for policymakers and
                    competition authorities

                    Innovations leading to the reduction of GHG emissions
                    constitute an important lever in the fight against pollution
                    and climate change. These innovations however often occupy
                    niche markets. The economic literature mainly delivers
                    insights on the promotion of innovations reducing the
                    production costs of renewable inputs. The present focuses on
                    emission-based innoavtions and compares the effects of
                    various regulations on the adoption of these innovations.
                    The analysis builds on a theoretical partial equilibrium
                    model representing a fuel industry that mixes biofuels with
                    fossil fuels, in the presence of an upstream innovator who
                    has developed an innovation reducing the level of biofuel
                    GHG emissions. We show that the fuel industry has no
                    incentive to adopt emissions-based innovation if there is no
                    regulation or if the regulation is on quantities (e.g.
                    quota). This first result therefore shows a limit to this
                    last widespread regulation which usually promotes the
                    adoption of innovations based on costs. We then show that
                    the industry can adopt emissions innovation with an excise
                    tax, or an emission standard (including a maximum fuel
                    emission level final). With a tax, such adoption is only
                    beneficial with a sufficienlty high tax rate or an
                    innovation that sufficiently reduces emissions. On the
                    contrary, with a standard, such an adoption is beneficial
                    with sufficiently strict standards and if the innovation
                    reduces slightly the emissions . This last counterintuitive
                    result implies that standards and taxes do not promote the
                    same level of innovation. Finally, we show that standards
                    promote both emission-based and cost-based innovations.

                    Two part tariff, demand uncertainty and risk aversion: From
                    theory to experimental evidence

                    In an uncertain demand environment, Rey and Tirole (1986)
                    show that the per unit price of a two-part tariff may have
                    insurance properties, insofar as it transfers risk from
                    downstream firms to upstream firms. In this paper, we test
                    this result in an experiment where the role of the subjects
                    is controlled according to their elicited risk aversion. The
                    role of the downstream firms is then held by the most risk
                    averse subjects. When the probability of meeting positive
                    demand is high, the experimental results confirm the the-
                    oretical prediction: the per unit price has insurance
                    properties such that it is higher than in a certain demand
                    environment and the part of the rent extracted by the fixed
                    part is lower. However, this insurance property does not
                    stand in the experimental results when the probability of
                    meeting positive demand is low. The results show that in
                    such cases there is insurance demand, and that high unit
                    prices are therefore accepted, but that this insurance
                    demand is not satisfied enough.
