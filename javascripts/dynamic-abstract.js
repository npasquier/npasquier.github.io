    <p> <strong> Abstract: </strong> We study a vertically integrated producer (VIP) that supplies a downstream firm under price competition. The VIP may decentralize the final price decision to its downstream unit; the latter thereby ignores the effect of the output price on upstream sales. We find that decentralization benefits the VIP -- irrespective of whether the products are substitutes or complements. Decentralization also benefits the consumers when products are substitutes, but it harms them when the products are complements. Interestingly, when products are substitutes, decentralization decreases both output prices despite restoring a double margin on the downstream unit's sales.</p>

    <p> <strong> Abstract: </strong> When a firm appoints a new manager, it reopens the possibility of new contractual friction with its partners. We explore strategic ambiguity as a potential for friction with a supplier. The firm's new manager probably has fuzzy expectations about the supplier's strategy. An optimistic manager weights favorable strategies more heavily than detrimental ones, whereas a pessimistic manager does the opposite. We show that the manager's degree of optimism is critical: above a threshold, it can cause the supplier to change the timing of its contracting and increase its profits. We also find that this threshold degree of optimism depends on the degree of product substitution: it is more stringent with imperfect substitutes than with perfect substitutes or unrelated goods.</p>

    <p> <strong> Abstract: </strong> The theoretical literature on vertical relationships usually assumes that beliefs about secret contracts take specific forms. In a recent paper, Eguia et al. (2018) propose a new selection criterion that does not impose any restriction on beliefs. In this article, we extend their criterion by generalizing it to risk-averse retailers, and we show that risk aversion modifies the size of the belief subsets that support each equilibrium. We conduct an experiment which revisits that of Eguia et al. (2018). We design a new treatment effect on equilibrium selection depending on the retailers' risk sensitivity. Experimental results confirm the treatment effect: the more sensitivity there is towards risk, the more the equilibrium played is consistent with passive beliefs. In addition, extending Eguia et al.'s (2018) criterion to risk-averse retailers improves its predictive power on the equilibria played, especially for a population of retailers with moderate to extreme risk aversion.</p>

    <p> <strong> Abstract: </strong> We investigate to what extent crop insurance can address the multiple risks faced by
    agricultural producers. Climatic, disease, technological and financial risks make insurance
    especially valuable to farmers. But their interactions and regulatory constraints also make
    insurance especially difficult to design. We stress that some risks (such as heavy rainfalls)
    can affect the feasibility of prevention and curative actions for other risks (such as crop diseases), so that risks, beyond correlation, compound in a complex way. In addition, existing
    regulations impose strong constraints that affect farmers' behavior.
    We contrast insurance in the US and in the EU, where different types of risks are covered.
    We illustrate some of the interactions between multiple risks, regulatory constraints on insurance and farmers' actions with the case of wine-growing in the South-West of France. We
    present data on correlation between rainfalls and mildew, and results from a real experiment
    designed to reduce treatments thanks to a conditional insurance.</p>

    <h1>Winners and Losers of Gatekeeper-Induced Consumer Preference Distortion in Promoting Personalized Pricing by Asymmetric Firms.</h1>

    <p> <strong> Abstract: </strong> We present a model of duopoly competition in a marketplace with a Hotelling segment of consumers, where two business users (firms) have access to raw consumer data. The firms can choose between personalized prices (PP), using a costly personalized program device provided by the marketplace, or uniform prices at no additional cost. One firm has a higher level of experience in utilizing consumer data, resulting in a lower cost of price personalization (PP device cost). In order to promote its personalized program device, the marketplace may have an incentive to distort consumer preferences from a uniform to a triangular distribution. Our findings indicate that the marketplace is more likely to distort consumer preferences under specific conditions. This occurs when there is moderate asymmetry in experience between the firms and a high tariff for the program, or when there is weak asymmetry and a moderate program tariff. In these parameter regions, the distortion of consumer preferences negatively impact the profits of the sellers while benefiting the consumers. These insights contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics of digital marketplaces and have implications for policymakers and competition authorities.</p>

    <p> <strong> Abstract: </strong> In an uncertain demand environment, the per-unit price of a two-part tariff can have
insurance properties, insofar as it transfers risk from risk-averse downstream firms to
less risk averse upstream firms, and compensation properties insofar as it compensates
downstream firms for lessened attractiveness of trade. Both properties have opposite
effects such as the first one can increase double marginalization and the second one can
mitigate it. This paper provides experimental evidence of both properties.</p>

    <h1>Promotion of emission-based innovations in the biofuel sector.</h1>

    <p> <strong> Abstract: </strong> Transitioning from fossil fuel to biofuel is a key strategy for reducing GHG emissions in energy-intensive sectors. While existing research has delved into how taxes, mandates, and other public interventions encourage this transition and stimulate cost-reducing innovations in biofuel production, the study of innovations aimed specifically at reducing biofuel emissions remains scant. Addressing this gap, our paper explores the impact of public interventions on the adoption of these emission-reducing innovations within the biofuel production. Through a model where an innovator markets such innovations to an industry which produces and blends biofuel with fossil fuel, we unveil how quota-based interventions fail to incentivize the industry towards adopting these innovations. Intriguingly, we then find that while an emission tax encourages the adoption of significant emission-reducing innovations, emission standards paradoxically favor only innovations yielding marginal improvements. Finally, we analyze the innovator's pricing strategy and its surplus sharing.  Our findings not only challenge conventional wisdom but also offers nuanced insights for policymakers aiming to refine regulatory measures to maximize the environmental benefits of biofuel innovation.</p>

    <p> <strong> Abstract: </strong> Crop insurance is a major component of the U.S. agricultural policy toolbox. On the contrary, only a small minority of E.U. farmers hold a subsidized insurance policy. We contrast the existing systems of subsidized insurance, that cover different risks. Interestingly, these different schemes give rise to different incentives for farmers to preserve the environment, in terms of adaptation, land use, and pesticide use. We focus on this latter aspect of the moral hazard problem and summarize existing empirical results. Apparently contradictory or inconclusive results can be related to the insurance system and crops under study. We discuss existing evidence about the impact on farmers' choices of green insurance -- an insurance contract conditional on pre-specified environmentally-friendly farmer behaviors. We offer a more in-depth survey for wine-growing, where pesticides are very inexpensive compared to the end-product, the extensive margin is quasi-null, and climatic and pest risks are correlated.</p>

    <p> <strong> Abstract: </strong> Various collective action problems can be described as discrete public good games with a threshold. In such games, a public good is provided when total contributions exceed a threshold. Yet, the latter is often not known with certainty because multiple models may predict its true value. We derive equilibria when players are either aware or ignorant about which model to pick. In other words, ambiguity may arise as a second layer of uncertainty (ignorance of which model to pick) in addition to risk which constitutes the first layer of uncertainty (each model only predicts the true threshold). When the contribution cost is sufficiently low, our result contrasts the existing literature: (i) the ignorant players contribute more than the aware players, and (ii) ignorance triggers a ”ratchet effect” yielding a minimum number of ignorant players to contribute.</p>
